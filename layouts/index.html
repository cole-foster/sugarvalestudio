            <h2>Crafted in Wood</h2>
            <p>In a world of fast furniture and flawless factory edges, woodworking still rewards patience. Each board
                carries a quiet record of seasons: tight winter rings, summer’s quick growth, a knot where wind once
                leaned. At Sugarvale Studio I lean into those stories—hand-selecting hardwoods, orienting grain for
                strength, and cutting joinery that locks without a shout. Surfaces are shaped with edge tools until
                light glides instead of glares, then finished in natural oils that can be renewed rather than discarded.
                The result: pieces meant to soften with use, burnish with touch, and earn their place as the background
                to daily life.</p>
